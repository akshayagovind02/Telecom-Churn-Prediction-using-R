# Telecom-Churn-Prediction

We will analyse the telecom dataset and explore the relationship between `canceled_service` and the other variables in the `telecom_df` data set. The goal of this  analysis is discovering which variables drive the differences between customers who do and do not cancel their service.

We will fit three classification algorithms to predict the response variable,`canceled_service` using all other variables in our dataset. 

We will use TidyVerse and TidyModels in R for data analysis and modelling.
